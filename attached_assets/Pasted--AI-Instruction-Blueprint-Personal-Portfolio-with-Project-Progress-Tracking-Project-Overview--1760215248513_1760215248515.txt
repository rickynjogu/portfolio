🧭 AI Instruction Blueprint — Personal Portfolio with Project Progress Tracking
🪄 Project Overview

You are my coding assistant.
We are building a personal portfolio website using React and Tailwind CSS as the frontend stack.

The site will showcase:

✅ Completed projects

🟡 In-progress projects

🕓 Upcoming (coming soon) projects

Each project card will display:

A progress banner or timer

Percentage of completion

Optional ETA and status

Later, this frontend will be connected to a Django backend for dynamic project updates.

🧱 Main Features
1. 🏡 Home Page

Profile section with:

👤 Personal photo / avatar

🧑‍💻 Name, tagline, and short intro (“What I do”)

📍 Optional location or title (e.g., “AI & Web Developer”)

CTA Buttons:

“View Projects”

“Contact Me” (scroll to contact section or opens modal)

Optional hero animation or banner (to make it modern)

2. 🧭 Projects Page

Display projects grouped by:
